These are a great buy if you have a child that does move too much when gaming! Unfortunately the sound has gone on one side of my Son’s pair and he hasn’t had them a year yet other than that they are great at everything else.
Great head set i use on my xbox one and pc. >only down side is the volume and mut control seems flimsey
Bought as a gift. No complaints from my nephew yet! I have the same design. Very comfortable and nice design.
perfect :)
Grandson loves them
Purchased these for teenage son. Delivered on time, my son is very satisfied with them and has no complaints about clarity in hearing and being heard
Great gaming headphones
High quality and comfy to wear. The mix quality is also good! Its handy that it comes with an extension that splits to Mic and headphones
If you want great build quality and sound these are perfect
they look great my son will love these delivery on time
Excellent quality. I have owned Turtle Beaches in the past and have to say that I really prefer these. Very comfortable for long wearing time and the sound is perfect.
Really happy with the product.
*Bought as a present.*   The sound quality of the Kraken Pro V2 is blinding. Very pleasantly surprised at the quality and flat response of the drivers in the headset.  Delivering a clear sound on all frequencies- from the top end right down to those deep bassey sounds. Without distortion even at loud levels! You wont loose this bright green headset easily, thats for sure.
Very happy, seen a lot of bad reviews but didnt bother me too much, guess these people didnt look after them..
