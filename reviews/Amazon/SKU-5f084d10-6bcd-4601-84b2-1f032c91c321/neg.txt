very bad headphones
Well i only had mine for a couple of months and the connection in the mic bit came lose and they would cut out so will never but krakens again
The sound quality is great, but the bass is a little lack-luster, the mic is good but incredibly loud; if youre buying this for the mic, turn it down in windows or youll hear constant echos.
Has to be the worst headset Razer has ever made...The mic is awful and it echos none stop when other people talk, and the mic quality is terrible. Wouldnt recommend.
Comfortable but connection rubbish on Xbox one controller.
