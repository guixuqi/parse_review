Awesome neckband headset. I’m a trucker and have tried many Bluetooth sets and this one truly impressed me. Solid design, good weight to the neckband, and transparency mode is great for walking outside truck stops. Only problem I have is from day 5, they wouldn’t stay connected to my iPhone XS Max or my S8+ and by day 7 they wouldn’t pair whatsoever. Really disappointed because it wasn’t the “typical truck headset” and sound was great. Only got about a good week out of them. Hopefully I had a lemon.
I had been anticipating a transatlantic flight, when I opted to get this headset.  So often the over-the-ear headsets are too bulky for space strapped backpacks.  This set fit in a tight spot in my bag. WHAT YOU GET: **** Headset consisting of a base, that sits on your shoulders with two wired earpieces **** Cable for charging USB to Mini USB B **** Cable for connecting Mini USB B to pin connector **** Carrying pouch with zippered pocket for the wires PAIRING TO PHONE IS SIMPLE BLUETOOTH PAIRING First I set up this headset with my phone, which was as simple as pairing the blue tooth and I tried them in all 3 modes: Normal, transparent and with ANC (Active Noise Cancelling on).  At home I noted a slight dulling of outside sound with ANC on.  But to me the real test was to be in a plane at altitude.  That constant noise can be maddening. CHARGING VIA STANDARD USB TO MINI USB-B: However since this same MINI -USB B receptacle on the headset is also how you are to connect for input, it would seem you cannot charge and use this headset at the same time, if you need a connector.  My boyfriend who had another headset, which needed charging could do both. CONNECTING ON A PLANE IS VIA A SINGLE JACK END: I have a connector that converts a single to a double jack end that are seen on some planes, but the one I was on, only needed a single one. So this is all I used. TESTING THE VARIOUS MODES FOUND LITTLE DIFFERENCE: I tried using this head set in transparent, normal and ANC mode and found little difference in transmission between the 3/.  While the head set worked fine with no distortion it did not seem to make the sound of the airplane any less.  I had good sound reproduction, and it was clear, but nothing else.  Years ago, I had an over the ear set that make a marked difference, so I had a point of comparison.. Alas, that headset, no longer worked. Also when a steward asked me a question in transparent mode (I had anticipated this) I had to take out the earpiece to understand. VOICE INFORMATION: Unlike a relatively inexpensive headset I have already, this set never told me how charged it was, so I found I was charging it fairly often just to be sure. I noted it had an up tone and down tone when powering on or off. Then it would state the mode when I powered up or when I changed it as: ANC On,Transparency On or Normal. ANC was the default. EARPIECE COMFORT: The ear pieces seemed to stay in well and were comfortable.  Mind you, I only wore them for a solid 5 hours and not 8 as a person who spends a lot of time on the phone would. They never seemed inclined to fall out.  With my long hair pulling out headsets when moving my hair is an issue, so even with the cords of this one, that was not an issue. IN SUMMARY: This headset was marginally better than what the airline provides.  For office use, these would be fine.  Reproduction of sounds is good.  ANC however is non-existent as far as I am concerned.
I was so excited to see Ankers new entrant in the neckband category.  I loved my previous LIFE neckbands (until the left ear stopped working - ANKER quickly replaced them before cancelling them). I wanted these to be my all day everyday headphones but I am fairly disappointed with the missed opportunities.  First off - the battery life is quite poor for their size and their pricepoint.  I just get about a day - maybe a little bit more or less - depending on the usage.  My previous Jabras lasted almost double. Noise cancelling is not for me - so I have no comment. Transparency mode is a gimmick.  It amplifies the wind - and turns down the music - I have not found any scenario where it is usable. I would LOVE a pair of these with no NC and no gimmicks - just a big battery.  Call them the Anker LONG LIFE.
I dont normally review, but I am a huge fan of Anker products, and thought it was important to share on this one. After four weeks with the headset, I decided tonight to return it. The co-worker I suggested try it only made it 10 days before returning. Many things I liked about it, but a few unfortunate deal-breakers. Note that I have worn a neckband headset daily for the past 6 years, and the most critical functionality for me is the call quality - both my ability to hear, and others ability to hear me. I spend about 16 hours a week on calls, and about 20 hours a week listening to podcasts. So what did I like? The Life NC headset is well built, and the sound quality is good. Battery life is pretty good, getting through a long day without issue. The earbuds magnetically snapping together helps a lot with keeping them in place, and the controls are intuitive, if very limited. They dont move around on your neck, and they look professional enough to wear to a customer site without issue. With all that going for it - why return them? Lots of little things, and a few bigger. The active noise canceling was ineffective to the point I had to concentrate to even hear a difference. I was not expecting an equivalent to my Bose QC30s, but I do ask that it be a noticeable difference. I tried in an airplane, an airport, several office spaces, in the car, mowing the lawn, etc. Completely ineffective. The sound quality was good, but that was done with large drivers, and associated fairly heavy buds. Even though the battery was on your neck, the weight in your ear was still close to that of Airpods. Livable, but definitely noticeable. The controls were pretty limited - activating the voice assistant is a 2 second hold, there is only a single rocker doing double duty as volume and forward/back, and the customization of buttons turned out to be "Do you want to fast forward after a double press or a long press?". The voice notifications were almost non-existent, in fact they only tell you power on and ANC mode. Forget to charge your headset? It wont tell you the battery level at any time, it will just beep a few times around 10% and then die. Not quite no warning - but that is cold comfort when you are on a call and it seems to just drop out. There is also no notification of the bluetooth connection state. This doesnt seem like a big deal when you only pull the buds out to use right then, but with a neckband headset it is common to wear them all the time, even while wandering around the house/office/yard. No warning if you happen to step out of range of your phone and are not actively listening to hear the sound cut out. Finally, and what pushed me over the tipping point: The audio quality is great for people listening to you on a call - as long as there is little/medium background noise. Quite office/home/car/hotel - no issue. Corner of a diner less than a quarter full? The person you are talking to not only hears all the background noise garble, they cant even hear you clearly. Same experience walking the sidewalk in LA at 9PM.  When you need to turn off bluetooth and hold your phone to the ear just so that your caller can understand you talking, that is a 100% deal breaker. Why bother with having a headset at all? So I am sending these back, going back to my 5 year old LG Tone neckband that cost less than half the price of the Life NC new, and continuing to search for an upgrade. I dont mind the price - my Bose were three times the price, and they also have issues picking up tons of background noise... But the Bose Active Noise Canceling is unbelievably good. Why would I hold onto these? They are not fantastic at anything - and not "good enough" at everything. PS: Not knocking off points as I knew going in, but support for a mute button (and maybe a redial button) would go a long way towards making this a winner in the professional space.
Not the quality I expected.  Had something similar. Sound quality isn’t that great and the battery life doesn’t last very long
I compared the Soundcore Life NC headphones to the Bose QC20i earbuds I usually use when traveling. The sound of the Soundcore was tinny without a good balance of bass. With earbud-style headphones a proper seal in the ear canal is critical. I normally use "medium" size ear tips, but had to use the small for the Soundcore. Even if I pressed the buds against my ears to seal better, the sound did not improve. When comparing, I used an iPhone X and Bluetooth for both (I have a Bluetooth adapter for the Bose set.) In the airplane, I was astonished at how little difference turning noise cancellation on made. (When you cycle through the modes, a voice announces the new mode.) The Lifecore did attenuate overall external sound somewhat, but not to a significant degree. In contrast, when I switch on the Bose, the general silence is very obvious. The Soundcore certainly didnt reduce the plane engine drone enough to be able to hear music over it. I also couldnt tell much difference when the passthrough mode was enabled, which is for being able to hear your surroundings (such as a flight attendant asking what you want to drink.) The Bose also has that feature, and it works. The Soundcore is comfortable to wear, both around the neck and in the ears. When not in use, the buds magnetically snap together. Charging is with a MicroUSB connection, and a second cable is included with a 1/8" phone plug on one end if you want to use the Soundcore wired. I really wanted to like the Soundcore Life NC, but the useless noise cancellation and poor sound quality means I cant recommend them.
Lasted 5 months! not sweat proof.  Overpriced for how it works.  Larger than most and a little clunky because of that.  Sound quality is ok. So if youre not some place where you are going to perspire at all they might work for you.
When these work, I love them.  I bought these in May and went everywhere with them; wore them everyday all through the day.  They had good calls and great better life... Then they abruptly stopped working, and won’t even turn on.  I attempted to charge them and the light does not come on anymore.  They weren’t dropped, submerged in water, or traumatized.  I generally love all Anker products but the short life of these makes me hesitant to buy Anker headphones in the future.
