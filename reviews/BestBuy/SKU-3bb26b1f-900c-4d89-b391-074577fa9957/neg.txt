For $79.99 you can do so much better, even save some money on a cheaper headset. I was so disappointed because out of the box it was one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever put on. The bass is also pretty good but those 2 are the only pros that I will give it. Tested on my ps4, Xbox one and pc only to receive complaints from friends that my mic was too low. I maxed out the settings on both consoles and my pc yet it didn’t do the trick. No $80 headset should have poor mic quality. Aside from good bass the audio was nothing spectacular either. This was my second time buying a Razer headset, this being a newer version and I regret wasting my time again on their products. Ended up having to return it and settling for the rig pro 500 which isn’t as comfortable as this headset but the mic and audio are superior.
The wiring connection quit working property after 3-4 months of use. I’d suggest purchasing an extended warranty with any headphone purchases. Even though the Best Buy warranty is into so so.
